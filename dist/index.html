                <p class="article__text">Improbably, I developed a yearning, almost from the get-go, to see a bear someday in the meadow. 
                    While I flossed in the morning, looking north through an upstairs bathroom window, 
                    I hoped to see a bear come out of the trees. If this seems quixotic, it was. This was four miles from the 
                    campus of Princeton University, around which on all sides was what New Yorkers were calling a bedroom community. 
                    Deer were present in large familial groups, as they still are in even larger families.They don’t 
                    give a damn about much of anything, and when <span class="article__text--red">I walk down the driveway
                         in the morning to pick up </span>the newspaper I all but have to push them out of the way. Beforehand, 
                         of course, I have been upstairs flossing, looking down the meadow. </p><br><br><p class="article__text"> No bears. <strong>In 1966, in 
                            a conversation in Trenton with Lester MacNamara, the head of the state’s Division of Fish and Game, 
                            I learned that there were twenty-two wild bears in New Jersey. </strong> Most lived on or near 
                            Kittatinny Mountain, in Sussex County, up the Delaware River. Sussex was once under a vertical 
                            kilometre of ice, and it looks it. It looks like Vermont. Kittatinny is actually a component 
                            of one very long mountain that runs, under various names, from Alabama to Newfoundland as the 
                            easternmost expression of the folded-and-faulted, deformed Appalachians. Through Sussex County, 
                            it carries the Appalachian Trail. Jersey bears are best off there, and they know they are best off there,
                             but they are as curious as they are hungry, and they range widely looking for mates. MacNamara happened 
                             to learn, while I was with him in his office, that a farmer in Pottersville had shot and killed 
                             a bear up a tree, and MacNamara, on his telephone, was shouting mad. Twenty-one.</p>
